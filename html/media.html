    <p>My name is Abasiakara Alexander, I am a frontend developer with 2 years of experience. I got into tech around
        2019, but I was off and on
        because I was still an undergraduate. My undergraduate engineering course required my full attention during
        school sessions. I took a couple of tech programs in betweenâ€”some I couldn't finish, but some I did.

        I got to say goodbye to dy/dx last year and landed a frontend internship role with an accounting startup.
        That experience
        exposed me to organizational programming, working with a team, and all that. I want to add backend skills to
        further understand how everything works, not just have vague knowledge, which is why I am here at Altschool.
        I
        am happy to be a part of this journey.</p>
    <p>My goals for the School of Engineering program
        is to graduate and also improve my knowledge for the long run of my career.
