        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I am a frontend developer with 2 years of experience. I got into tech around 2019, but I was off and on
            because I was still an undergraduate. My undergraduate engineering course required my full attention during
            school sessions. I took a couple of tech programs in betweenâ€”some I couldn't finish, but some I did.

            I got to say goodbye to dy/dx last year and landed a frontend internship role with an accounting startup.
            That experience
            exposed me to organizational programming, working with a team, and all that. I want to add backend skills to
            further understand how everything works, not just have vague knowledge, which is why I am here at Altschool.
            I
            am happy to be a part of this journey. </p>
